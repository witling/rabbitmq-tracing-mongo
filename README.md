An opinionated tracing plugin for RabbitMQ management. Build it like
any other plugin. After installation you should see a "Tracing" tab in
the management UI. Hopefully use is obvious.

Configuration
=============

There is three configuration options:

mongo_ip: The MongoDB ip address for saving the tracing data.
mongo_port: The MongoDB port for saving the tracing data.
username: name of the user as which to create queues and bind to the
tracing exchange. Obviously this user will need to exist and have
permission to do those things.


HTTP API
========

GET            /api/traces
GET            /api/traces/<vhost>
GET PUT DELETE /api/traces/<vhost>/<name>

Example for how to start a trace:

$ curl -i -u guest:guest -H "content-type:application/json" -XPUT \
  http://localhost:55672/api/traces/%2f/my-trace \
  -d'{"pattern":"#"}'

Installation
==============

This plugin needs emongo.

	cd plugins
	git clone https://github.com/JacobVorreuter/emongo
	cd emongo
	make

Or clone the emongo-wrapper
	
	git clone https://github.com/doubaokun/emongo-wrapper

Add the following to config file:

	{env,[{username,<<"guest">>},
                    {mongo_ip,"192.168.49.64"},
                    {mongo_port,27017}]}
